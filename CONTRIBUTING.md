# Contributing to the Borealis Project

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the Borealis Project! This document provides guidelines for contributing to the project. Please read these guidelines carefully before you start working on the project.

## Workflow

The project uses two main branches:

- `main`: This branch reflects the production-ready state of the project.
- `dev`: This is the development branch where active development happens. All new features, bug fixes, and enhancements are merged into this branch before being included in the `main` branch.

## How to Contribute

To make a contribution, please follow these steps:

1. **Fork the Repository**

   - Fork the repository to your own GitHub account.

2. **Clone Your Fork**

   - Clone your fork to your local machine.

3. **Create a New Branch**

   - Create a new branch from the `dev` branch for your work. This helps keep the history clean and the main branch stable.
   - Use a clear branch name that describes the feature or fix you'll be working on.

4. **Make Your Changes**

   - Make your changes locally and commit them in logical units to your branch.
   - Follow the coding standards and write clean, maintainable code.
   - Ensure your code adheres to the existing style of the project to make the review process faster.

5. **Keep Your Branch Updated**

   - Regularly pull changes from the upstream `dev` branch to keep your branch up to date and avoid merge conflicts.

6. **Write Tests**

   - Add tests for your changes to ensure that your feature works as expected and to prevent regressions.

7. **Document Your Changes**

   - Update the documentation to reflect your changes if necessary.
   - Add comments in your code to explain non-obvious parts of your code.

8. **Submit a Pull Request (PR)**

   - Push your changes to your fork on GitHub and submit a pull request from your branch to the `dev` branch in the original repository.
   - In the pull request, describe what your changes do and mention any bugs/issues related to the changes.

9. **Code Review**

   - After your pull request is submitted, it will be reviewed.
   - Make any requested changes and push them to your branch.
   - Your changes will be merged into the `dev` branch once they are approved.

10. **After Merging**
    - After your pull request is merged, you can safely delete your branch.

## Pull Request Best Practices

- **Title**: Use a clear and descriptive title for your pull request.
- **Description**: Provide a detailed description of the changes. Link to any relevant issues or discussions.
- **Small Changes**: Keep your pull requests small and focused. If you have multiple unrelated changes, submit them as separate pull requests.
- **Verification**: Before submitting your pull request, self-review your changes and run all the tests to ensure everything is working correctly.

## Reporting Bugs

When reporting bugs, include as much information as possible about how to reproduce the bug. If possible, include:

- The environment in which you encountered the bug (OS, version).
- Steps to reproduce the bug.
- The expected and actual outcomes.
- Any error messages or logs.

## Feature Requests

Feature requests are welcome. Please search the existing issues for your feature before creating a new one. Provide as much detail and context as possible about what you're looking to achieve.

## Questions or Help

If you have questions or need help, please open an issue for discussion.
